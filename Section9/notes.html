<!--flexbox disregards the normal layouts of 
block, inline and inline-blocks (elements like ul/ol/div)
get directly impacted by this. -->


<!-- Inline-flex just uses the bare minimum flex to contain 
 all the content
 -->

<!--Flexbox propoerties:
    1. flex-wrap (parent)
    2. gap (parent)
    3. flex-direction (parent)
    4. flex-basis (child)
    5. order (child)
    6. justify-content (parent) (along main axis)
    7. align-items (parent) (along cross axis) (have to set height first) (friction with wrap)
    8. align-self (child) (same as align-items but specific to the children)
    9. align-content (parent) (need wrap)
    10. flex-flow -> flex-direction + flex-wrap
    11. flex-grow 
    12. flex-shrink : both can be 0(off) / other value (on)
    13. flex: GROW SHRINK BASIS

<!-- Flexbox Demonstration: https://appbrewery.github.io/flex-layout/-->

<!-- wrap property creates a 2D flexbox. There main-axis
 and cross-axis is more important to consider.-->

 <!-- vh -> viewport height-->

 <!-- Flexbox size setting priority-> min-width/max-width > flex-basis > width > content width-->
  <!-- >>>>> this priority depends on space availibility (until there is space left in the container
   ,  this order is honored). When space is limited/shrunken, first content-minimum-width (i.e. longest word length) is
   prioritized for setting flexbox, and if even that requires more space than left in the container, flexbox just pushed it
   out of the viewport. 
   -->

   <!-- max-width -> sets how wide a flex can be at maximum (highest priority in flexbox size setting)-->
    <!-- If max/min-width is set, then even if the browswer is maximized/shruken the flexbox wont get bigger/smaller than the set size.-->
